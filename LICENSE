2. Clarification on Patches
---------------------------
To support collaborative development while preserving the integrity of
the original work:

- You MAY create and distribute patch files (e.g. diffs, changesets,
  commits) that describe modifications to this project.  
- A patch file is considered your own original work, not a derivative
  work of this project, provided it does not contain substantial
  portions of the original code verbatim.  
- You MAY circulate patches under any license of your choosing.  
- You MAY NOT distribute built artifacts, compiled binaries, or complete
  modified source trees incorporating this project without explicit
  written permission from the copyright holder(s). Doing so constitutes
  distribution of a derivative work and is prohibited under the base
  CC BY-NC-ND license.

3. Encouragement
----------------
For maximum transparency and collaboration, contributors are encouraged
to share and exchange their work as patch sets using patch-centric
version control systems (such as Jujutsu, Quilt, Darcs, or similar).
This ensures that modifications remain auditable, remixable, and clearly
separated from the canonical source.

- Sharing original source: permitted under CC BY-NC-ND.  
- Sharing patches: permitted and encouraged.  
- Sharing full modified versions or binaries: prohibited without
  permission.
